To create a beginner Python project for a Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

1. **Design the Game Logic**:
   - Understand the rules: Youll need to check if either player (X or O) wins or if the game ends
   in a draw.
   - Represent the board: Use a 3x3 grid (which can be a list of lists) to store the moves.
   - Develop functions to display the board, check for win conditions, and handle player moves.

2. **Create the Game Board**:
   - Use a list of lists to represent the 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid will be initially empty.
   - You will need a function to print the grid after each move, so players can see the current
   state.

3. **Turn-based System**:
   - Implement a way to alternate turns between the two players.
   - Ensure each player can place their marker (X or O) on an empty cell, and check after each move
   if someone has won.

4. **Win Condition**:
   - After every move, check whether a player has won by having three of their markers in a row
   (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - If the board is full and no one has won, declare a draw.

5. **Input Validation**:
   - Allow players to input their move (usually a number corresponding to a cell on the grid) and
   check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell isnt already taken and is within the bounds of the
   board).

6. **Game Loop**:
   - Use a loop to keep the game running until theres a winner or the game ends in a draw.
   - After each move, check for a win or a draw, then ask the next player to make a move.

7. **Additional Features** (optional for beginners):
   - You could add a way to restart the game or keep track of the score.
   - You could even extend the project to allow two players to play on the same computer or add a
   simple AI opponent.

By following these steps, youll create a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game that covers the
basics of Python programming, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists.
